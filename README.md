<h1>Hybrid LSTM Model for Stock Price Prediction</h1>
Overview
This project combines LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with Linear Regression to predict stock prices. The LSTM model captures time-dependent patterns in stock price data, while Linear Regression is used for modeling broader trends.

<h2>Features</h2>

Hybrid Model: Combines LSTM for time-series prediction and Linear Regression for trend forecasting.
Stock Price Prediction: Predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
<h3>Requirements</h3>
Python
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
